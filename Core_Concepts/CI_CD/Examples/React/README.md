### **CI/CD Pipeline Examples for Deploying a Basic React Application**

This repository provides two practical examples of setting up CI/CD pipelines to deploy a basic **React** application:

1. **Azure Pipelines**: Automating build and deployment using Azure DevOps.
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automating build and deployment using GitHub Actions.

These examples are designed to help you understand how to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for React applications in two popular platforms. Additionally, this guide includes information on how the React frontend can dynamically connect to its backend API in different environments (e.g., dev, UAT, prod).

## **Connecting Frontend to Backend in Different Environments**

In a real-world application, the React frontend needs to connect to a backend API (e.g., a .NET Web API). The backend API URL will differ across environments (dev, UAT, prod). Hereâ€™s how to handle this:

### **1. Environment Variables**

- Use environment variables to store the backend API URL for each environment.
- Create `.env` files for each environment:
  - `.env.development`: For the `develop` branch.
  - `.env.uat`: For the `release` branch.
  - `.env.production`: For the `main` branch.

Example `.env` file:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api-dev.example.com
```

Here's the updated documentation for using environment variables with Vite:

---

### **1. Environment Variables**

- Use environment variables to store the backend API URL for each environment.
- Create `.env` files for each environment:
  - `.env.development`: For the `develop` branch.
  - `.env.uat`: For the `release` branch.
  - `.env.production`: For the `main` branch.

Example `.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api-dev.example.com
```

Note: In Vite, the environment variable names must start with `VITE_` to be exposed to the frontend.

### **2. Access Environment Variables in React**

- Use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` in your React code to access the backend API URL.
- Example in `src/api.js`:

  ```javascript
  const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

  export const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/data`);
    return response.json();
  };
  ```

### **3. Configure CI/CD Pipelines**

- Inject the correct environment variables during the build process based on the branch:
  - `develop` â†’ Use `.env.development`.
  - `release` â†’ Use `.env.uat`.
  - `main` â†’ Use `.env.production`.

---

With Vite, the process for handling environment variables is slightly different from React's Create React App (CRA) which is now deprecated. You need to prefix the variable names with `VITE_` for them to be available in the frontend code.

## **Example 1: Azure Pipelines**

This example demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using **Azure Pipelines** to build and deploy a React application to **Azure Static Web Apps**.

### **Steps**

1. **Create an Azure Static Web App**:

   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Create a new Static Web App for each environment (dev, UAT, prod).
   - Note down the Static Web App names and resource groups for later use.

2. **Set Up Azure Pipelines**:

   - Navigate to Azure DevOps and create a new project.
   - Go to **Pipelines** > **Create Pipeline** and connect your GitHub repository.
   - Use the `azure-pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml` file provided in this repository.

3. **Pipeline Configuration**:

   - The `azure-pipelines.yml` file includes:
     - **Build**: Installs dependencies, builds the React app, and injects environment variables.
     - **Deploy**: Deploys the app to the appropriate Azure Static Web App based on the branch.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Push changes to your repository to trigger the pipeline.
   - Monitor the pipeline in Azure DevOps to ensure successful deployment.

## **Example 2: GitHub Actions**

This example demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to build and deploy a React application to **Azure Static Web Apps**.

### **Steps**

1. **Create an Azure Static Web App**:

   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Create a new Static Web App for each environment (dev, UAT, prod).
   - Note down the Static Web App names and resource groups for later use.

2. **Set Up GitHub Secrets**:

   - Go to your GitHub repository > **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: JSON credentials for Azure service principal.
     - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Your Azure subscription ID.
     - `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`: The resource group for your Static Web App.
     - `AZURE_APP_NAME_PREFIX`: The prefix for your Static Web App names (e.g., `ReactApp`).

3. **Pipeline Configuration**:

   - The `github-actions/react-ci-cd.yml` file includes:
     - **Build**: Installs dependencies, builds the React app, and injects environment variables.
     - **Deploy**: Deploys the app to the appropriate Azure Static Web App based on the branch.

4. **Run the Workflow**:
   - Push changes to your repository to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.
   - Monitor the workflow in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.
