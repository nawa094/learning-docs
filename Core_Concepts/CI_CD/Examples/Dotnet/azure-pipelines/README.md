This is an example of an **Azure Pipelines YAML file** (`azure-pipelines.yml`) that implements a CI/CD pipeline for a .NET Web API application. This pipeline follows **Git Flow**, where:

- The `main` branch is deployed to **Production**.
- The `release` branch is deployed to **UAT** (User Acceptance Testing).
- The `develop` branch is deployed to **Dev**.

The pipeline includes steps to:

1. **Build** the .NET Web API application.
2. **Run tests** (if any).
3. **Deploy** to the appropriate Azure Web App instance based on the branch.

### **Explanation of the Pipeline**

#### **1. Trigger**

- The pipeline triggers on changes to the `main`, `release`, and `develop` branches.

#### **2. Variables**

- `buildConfiguration`: Specifies the build configuration (e.g., `Release`).
- `azureSubscription`: Your Azure subscription name.
- `appNamePrefix`: Prefix for the Azure Web App name.
- `resourceGroup`: Your Azure resource group name.

#### **3. Stages**

- **Build Stage**:
  - Restores NuGet packages.
  - Builds the .NET project.
  - Runs unit tests (if any test projects are present).
- **Deploy Stage**:
  - Publishes the .NET project to a folder.
  - Deploys the published artifacts to the appropriate Azure Web App based on the branch.

#### **4. Parameters**

- `appName`: Dynamically sets the Azure Web App name based on the branch:
  - `main` â†’ `DotNetWebApi-prod`
  - `release` â†’ `DotNetWebApi-uat`
  - `develop` â†’ `DotNetWebApi-dev`

#### **5. Deployment**

- The `AzureRmWebAppDeployment` task deploys the application to the specified Azure Web App.

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Azure Web Apps**:
   - Create three Azure Web Apps:
     - `DotNetWebApi-prod` (for `main` branch).
     - `DotNetWebApi-uat` (for `release` branch).
     - `DotNetWebApi-dev` (for `develop` branch).
2. **Azure Service Connection**:
   - Set up an Azure service connection in Azure DevOps:
     - Go to **Project Settings** > **Service Connections** > **New Service Connection** > **Azure Resource Manager**.
     - Provide your Azure subscription details.

---

### **How to Use**

1. Replace placeholders (e.g., `your-azure-subscription-name`, `your-resource-group-name`) with your actual Azure details.
2. Push the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to your repository.
3. The pipeline will automatically trigger on changes to the `main`, `release`, or `develop` branches.
4. Monitor the pipeline in Azure DevOps to ensure successful builds and deployments.

This pipeline provides a robust foundation for implementing Git Flow with Azure Pipelines. You can extend it further by adding stages for integration testing, performance testing, or approvals for production deployments. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸš€
