✅ Hosting **enterprise applications** with authentication and security controls.

### **Pricing Considerations**

- **Free Tier**: Ideal for basic testing and learning.
- **Shared & Basic Plans**: Low-cost, suitable for small apps.
- **Standard, Premium, and Isolated Plans**: Support **high availability (HA), scaling, and advanced networking**.

### **Best Practices**

✅ Use **Deployment Slots** for staging and production rollouts.  
✅ Enable **Application Insights** for monitoring and diagnostics.  
✅ Implement **Managed Identity** for secure authentication to other Azure services.  
✅ Use **Azure Front Door** or **Azure Traffic Manager** for global load balancing.

## **2. Azure Functions**

### **Overview**

Azure Functions is a **serverless compute service** that allows you to run event-driven functions **without managing infrastructure**.

### **Key Features**

- **Event-Driven Execution**: Triggered by **HTTP requests, timers, queue messages, database changes, and events**.
- **Auto Scaling**: Scales automatically based on demand.
- **Multiple Language Support**: Supports **C#, JavaScript, Python, Java, and PowerShell**.
- **Built-in Security**: Integrates with **Azure Key Vault**, Managed Identity, and authentication providers.
- **Consumption-Based Pricing**: Pay only for execution time.

### **Use Cases**

✅ **Microservices & APIs**: Build lightweight, event-driven APIs.  
✅ **Automated Tasks**: Schedule **cron jobs**, clean up storage, send notifications.  
✅ **Data Processing**: Process messages from **Azure Event Hubs, Service Bus, and Storage Queues**.  
✅ **Real-Time Processing**: Analyze real-time data streams from **IoT devices or event sources**.

### **Pricing Considerations**

- **Consumption Plan** (pay per execution).
- **Premium Plan** (better performance, auto-scaling).
- **Dedicated Plan** (for long-running or resource-intensive workloads).

### **Best Practices**

✅ Use **Durable Functions** for long-running workflows.  
✅ Optimize performance by **reducing cold starts** (use **Premium Plan** or **pre-warmed instances**).  
✅ Secure function endpoints using **Azure AD authentication and API Management**.  
✅ Use **Application Insights** to monitor execution and failures.

## **3. Azure SQL Database**

### **Overview**

Azure SQL Database is a **fully managed relational database** service built on SQL Server.

### **Key Features**

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: No need to manage OS, patches, or backups.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Supports vertical and horizontal scaling.
- **High Availability**: Built-in **geo-replication, failover groups, and zone redundancy**.
- **Advanced Security**: Uses **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), Always Encrypted, and Managed Identity**.
- **Intelligent Performance Tuning**: Built-in **AI-driven indexing and query optimization**.

### **Deployment Options**

1. **Single Database** – Fully isolated database instance.
2. **Elastic Pool** – A pool of databases that share resources.
3. **Managed Instance** – SQL Server with near 100% compatibility for on-prem migration.

### **Use Cases**

✅ **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** for applications.  
✅ **Data Warehousing & Analytics** (integrates with Power BI, Synapse Analytics).  
✅ **Business Applications** requiring strong security & compliance.  
✅ **IoT & Real-Time Applications** that process high-velocity data.

### **Pricing Considerations**

- **DTU-based Model**: Simple compute+storage pricing.
- **vCore Model**: More flexible CPU/memory/storage configurations.
- **Serverless**: Auto-pauses when not in use to save costs.

### **Best Practices**

✅ Use **Geo-Replication** for disaster recovery.  
✅ Enable **Azure Defender for SQL** for threat protection.  
✅ Use **Index Advisor & Query Performance Insights** to optimize queries.  
✅ Store **secrets & credentials** in **Azure Key Vault** instead of hardcoding.

## **4. Azure Storage**

### **Overview**

Azure Storage is a **scalable, durable, and secure cloud storage solution**.

### **Key Features**

- **Highly Available**: 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability.
- **Multiple Storage Tiers**: Hot, Cool, and Archive tiers optimize cost.
- **Integrated Security**: Uses **encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), and private endpoints**.
- **Scalable & Flexible**: Handles **petabytes** of structured & unstructured data.

### **Storage Types**

1. **Blob Storage**

   - Stores **unstructured** data (documents, images, videos).
   - Supports **page blobs, block blobs, and append blobs**.
   - Use **SAS tokens & Managed Identity** for secure access.

2. **Table Storage**

   - NoSQL key-value store.
   - Ideal for **log data, metadata, and telemetry storage**.

3. **Queue Storage**

   - Message queue system for decoupled microservices.
   - Used with Azure Functions for event-driven architectures.

4. **File Storage (Azure Files)**

✅ Managing **message queues for microservices** (Queue Storage).  
✅ Storing **large analytical datasets** for AI/ML (Data Lake Storage).  
✅ Replacing on-prem file servers with **Azure Files**.

### **Pricing Considerations**

- **Hot Storage**: Frequent access, higher cost.
- **Cool Storage**: Infrequent access, lower cost.
- **Archive Storage**: Cheapest, but high latency for retrieval.
