## **1. Trading 🏦📈**

### **What is Trading?**

Trading is the **buying and selling of financial assets** (e.g., stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities) in financial markets. Large financial institutions **facilitate trading for clients** (institutional and retail investors) and sometimes **trade on their own behalf** (proprietary trading).

### **Types of Trading in Large Banks:**

1. **Equities Trading** – Buying/selling stocks (e.g., Apple shares).
2. **Fixed Income Trading** – Trading government/corporate bonds.
3. **Foreign Exchange (FX) Trading** – Currency trading (e.g., USD/EUR).
4. **Derivatives Trading** – Contracts based on underlying assets (e.g., options, futures).

### **How Banks Implement Trading Systems:**

✅ **Trading Platforms** – Banks use electronic trading systems (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, in-house trading systems).  
✅ **Risk Management Systems** – Automated checks ensure trades comply with regulations and risk limits.  
✅ **Latency Optimization** – High-frequency trading (HFT) systems require ultra-low latency for executing trades in milliseconds.  
✅ **Order Matching Engines** – Ensure buyers and sellers are matched efficiently in an exchange or Over-The-Counter (OTC) market.

### **Your Role as a Software Engineer:**

- Build and maintain **trading applications** with **real-time pricing, order execution, and risk checks**.
- Work with APIs to **integrate external market data providers**.
- Ensure **system reliability**—even milliseconds of downtime can result in massive losses.

2. **Funding & Borrowing** – Raising capital through bonds or interbank lending.
3. **Interest Rate & Currency Risk Management** – Hedging against market fluctuations.

### **How Banks Implement Treasury Systems:**

✅ **Cash Management Systems** – Track daily cash positions across multiple accounts and jurisdictions.

2. **Bond Markets** – Governments and corporations issue bonds to raise capital.
3. **Foreign Exchange (FX) Markets** – Large institutions trade currencies to manage risk and facilitate international transactions.
4. **Commodities Markets** – Banks facilitate trading in oil, gold, and agricultural products.

### **How Banks Implement Wholesale Trading Systems:**
